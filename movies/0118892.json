When Veronica Franco comes of age, she cannot marry Marco Venier, whom she loves, because she is well born but penniless. Her choice: cloister or courtesan. She steels her heart, and with beauty and intelligence becomes the best. She's a heroine when she helps convince France to aid Venice in war with Turks, but when plague descends, the Church charges her with witchcraft. At her inquisition, she must match wits with an old rival, speak for all women, and call courage from Venier.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzQzMDlmYjgtZTcyNy00YTg5LTk5OGUtMmY1YWY4YmE0MjQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMwMjk0MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"68%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"15,842","imdbID":"tt0118892","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"New Regency Pictures, Bedford Falls Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
