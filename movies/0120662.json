Stephen Wilson, a.k.a. the Eye, comes across a disturbed lady serial-killer while on an otherwise mundane assignment. Already a bit psychologically fragile from his wife's abrupt removal of herself and their daughter from his life (with the lingering memory of his daughter haunting him like a manifest ghost), his psychosis as a displaced dad dovetails with the femme fatale's psychosis as an abandoned daughter (crying \"Merry Christmas, Daddy\" over her expired victims). A bond forms, or, rather, an obsession, as the Eye abandons his job to secretively stalk this mysterious woman full-time as she visits many major U.S. cities under various names, leaving numerous victims.","Language":"English","Country":"Canada, UK, Australia, USA","Awards":"1 win.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzUzMWY1NTItMTE3MS00YWQ3LWJkZDQtY2IyZDZjZDhkYjA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjk1NzAxNg@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"9%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"29/100"}],"Metascore":"29","imdbRating":"5.1","imdbVotes":"14,474","imdbID":"tt0120662","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Hit &amp; Run Productions, Eye of the Beholder Ltd., Village Roadshow Prod., Behaviour Worldwide, Ambridge Film Partnership, Filmline International","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
