{"Title":"42 Up","Year":"1998","Rated":"N/A","Released":"21 Jul 1998","Runtime":"139 min","Genre":"Documentary, Biography","Director":"Michael Apted","Writer":"N/A","Actors":"Bruce Balden, Jacqueline Bassett, Symon Basterfield, Andrew Brackfield","Plot":"In 1964, a film crew interviewed seven-year-old English kids: five or six from privilege, a Yorkshire farm lad, East-End girls, and boys from a children's home. Every seven years, Michael Apted re-interviews those willing (two declined this time). At 42, careers are stuck or flourishing; marriages are strong, shaky, or over (and Bruce recently married for the first time). They're dealing with parents' dying, and children coming-of-age. One is a single mom with young sons. One is remarried, but how are the five children from his first marriage? Lyn and Jackie face health problems with down-to-earth lucidity. Neil, on the margin at 28 and 35, has a glorious story of friendship at 42.","Language":"English, Latin","Country":"UK","Awards":"1 win & 9 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNjYxMzUwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjI3OTgxMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"89%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"86/100"}],"Metascore":"86","imdbRating":"8.2","imdbVotes":"2,375","imdbID":"tt0164312","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
