He's now in trouble with the mob boss, Tom French, who sends Git to Cork with another debtor, Bunny Kelly, to find a guy named Frank Grogan, and take him to a man with a friendly face at a shack across a bog. It's a tougher assignment than it seems: Git's a novice, Bunny's prone to rash acts, Frank doesn't want to be found (and once he's found, he has no money), and maybe Tom's planning to murder Frank, which puts Git in a moral dilemma. Then, there's the long-ago disappearance of Sonny Mulligan. What's a decent and stand-up lad to do?","Language":"English","Country":"Ireland, UK, USA","Awards":"10 wins & 7 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjljNTBlYmItYTY0NS00ODQ0LThjNTMtZmY1NTU4NTQ0MzM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDU5NDcxNw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"84%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"69/100"}],"Metascore":"69","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"1,983","imdbID":"tt0126344","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"BBC","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
