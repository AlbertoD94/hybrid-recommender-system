He also sleeps with his sister, organises elaborate orgies and embarks on a fruitless invasion of Britain before meeting an appropriate end. There are various versions of the film, ranging from the heavily truncated 90-minute version to the legendary 160-minute hardcore version which leaves nothing to the imagination (though the hardcore scenes were inserted later and do not involve the main cast members).","Language":"Italian, English","Country":"Italy","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzI2ZGQwZjYtMGM3OS00MDU4LThlMWMtZWU3ZmQzYWZmZTQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDkzNTM2ODg@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"23%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.4","imdbVotes":"33,261","imdbID":"tt0080491","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
