{"Title":"For All Mankind","Year":"1989","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"19 May 1989","Runtime":"80 min","Genre":"Documentary, History","Director":"Al Reinert","Writer":"N/A","Actors":"Jim Lovell, Russell Schweickart, Eugene Cernan, Michael Collins","Plot":"This movie documents the Apollo missions perhaps the most definitively of any movie under two hours. Al Reinert watched all the footage shot during the missions--over 6,000,000 feet of it, and picked out the best. Instead of being a newsy, fact-filled documentary, Reinart focuses on the human aspects of the space flights. The only voices heard in the film are the voices of the astronauts and mission control. Reinart uses the astronaunts' own words from interviews and mission footage. The score by Brian Eno underscores the strangeness, wonder, and beauty of the astronauts' experiences which they were privileged to have for a first time \"for all mankind.\"","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"Nominated for 1 Oscar.
