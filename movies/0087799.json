But upon daybreak, when the girls discover that they are the only residents of Los Angeles whom the comet hasn't vaporized or turned into a zombie, they would do what all Valley Girls do - they go shopping. However, with the help of a friendly truck driver, the girls save Earth and escape from flesh-eating zombies and blood-seeking scientists in hot pursuit.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTQzZDVkMTctYTdlZi00MTc2LWJhMTEtM2VmZjY1MzFiYjI5L2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.4/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"78%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"59/100"}],"Metascore":"59","imdbRating":"6.4","imdbVotes":"18,362","imdbID":"tt0087799","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Thomas Coleman and Michael Rosenblatt Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
