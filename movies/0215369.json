He finds his father hard at work at the family's bathhouse (the false message was a ruse of Da's mentally-handicapped, exuberant brother, Er Ming, to get Da home). Da stays a couple days, observing his father being social director, marriage counselor, and dispute mediator for his customers and a boon companion to Er. Da is caught between worlds: the decaying district of his childhood and the booming south where he now lives with a wife who's not met his family. When Da realizes his father's health is failing and the district is slated for razing, he must take stock of family and future.","Language":"Mandarin, Italian","Country":"China","Awards":"17 wins & 10 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzQ2Njg0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNTIwNTU5._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"87%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"74/100"}],"Metascore":"74","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"3,871","imdbID":"tt0215369","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Imar Film, Xi&#39;an Film Studio","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
