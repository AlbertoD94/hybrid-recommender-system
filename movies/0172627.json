The men prepare by talking about sex and drinking. Rick and Jean, two attorneys, have set up the evening, connect at the club, and have a good time. The pairings of Shawn, Trent, Whitney and Emma are more serendipitous. But it's Mike and Sara's night that has serious repercussions: he's an NFL player, loud, swaggering; she's a party animal who drinks a lot early that evening. At 4 AM, she appears at Jean's, disheveled and bruised, saying Mike raped her. Arrested, he says he's innocent, and in flashbacks we see both sides of the story.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTIxNDAxMmQtYTg4Ny00NzczLWJiNTItNDM2ODA5Y2FmZmQxL2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"4.9/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"11%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"36/100"}],"Metascore":"36","imdbRating":"4.9","imdbVotes":"5,205","imdbID":"tt0172627","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"New Line Cinema","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
