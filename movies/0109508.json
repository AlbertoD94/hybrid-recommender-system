Crumb. Robert Crumb is the cartoonist/artist who drew Keep On Truckin', Fritz the Cat, and played a major pioneering role in the genesis of underground comix. Through interviews with his mother, two brothers, wife, and ex-girlfriends, as well as selections from his vast quantity of graphic art, we are treated to a darkly comic ride through one man's subconscious mind. As stream-of-consciousness images incessantly flow forth from the tip of his pen, biting social satire is revealed, often along with a disturbing and haunting vision of Crumb's own betes noires and inadequacies. As his acid-trip induced images flicker across our own retinas, we gain a little insight into this complex and highly creative individual.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"17 wins & 6 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTViMDM5YjktMDhjNy00MjZjLTg2ODctOGI3MzkzYWNiODA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTAyODkwOQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"95%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"93/100"}],"Metascore":"93","imdbRating":"8.0","imdbVotes":"18,293","imdbID":"tt0109508","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Superior Pictures","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
