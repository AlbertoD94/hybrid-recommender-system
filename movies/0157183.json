Tarek is in high school, making Super 8 movies with his friend, Omar. At first the war is a lark: school has closed, the violence is fascinating, getting from West to East is a game. His mother wants to leave; his father refuses. Tarek spends time with May, a Christian, orphaned and living in his building. By accident, Tarek goes to an infamous brothel in the war-torn Olive Quarter, meeting its legendary madam, Oum Walid. He then takes Omar and May there using her underwear as a white flag for safe passage. Family tensions rise. As he comes of age, the war moves inexorably from adventure to tragedy.","Language":"Arabic, French","Country":"France, Norway, Lebanon, Belgium","Awards":"8 wins & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzE0NzdkMmUtNTJlOC00ZGEyLTg1MDctZjdhNDQ4MTc5YzkyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"94%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"3,101","imdbID":"tt0157183","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
