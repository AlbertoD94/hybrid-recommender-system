{"Title":"Beautiful Thing","Year":"1996","Rated":"R","Released":"09 Oct 1996","Runtime":"90 min","Genre":"Comedy, Drama, Romance","Director":"Hettie Macdonald","Writer":"Jonathan Harvey, Jonathan Harvey (play)","Actors":"Linda Henry, Glen Berry, Scott Neal, Tameka Empson","Plot":"A tender love story set during a hot summer on a South-East London housing estate. Jamie, a relatively unpopular lad who bunks off school to avoid football, lives next door to Ste, a more popular athletic lad but who is frequently beaten up by his father and older brother. Such an episode of violence brings Jamie and Ste together: Sandra (Jamie's mum) offers refugee to Ste, who has to 'top-and-tail' with Jamie. Hence, the story tells of their growing attraction for one another, from initial lingering glances to their irrefutable love, which so magnificently illustrated at the end of the film. It deals with the tribulations of coming to terms with their sexuality and of others finding out, in light of Sandra's unwavering loyalty and defence of Jamie and the fear of repercussion should Ste's family find out. The plot is set against sub-texts of Sandra's desire to manage her own pub, and thus escape the estate, and of her new relationship with her hippy boyfriend Tony; and of Leah, the brassy girl next door who has been expelled from school and spends her time listening to Mama Cass records and tripping on a variety of drugs.","Language":"English","Country":"UK","Awards":"4 wins & 3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM4OTllMzYtZmQ0YS00MDU3LTliZDktNjMzYmQ4ZjRjMmFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"91%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"22,363","imdbID":"tt0115640","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
