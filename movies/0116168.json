The team is struggling with a mediocre record when, in mid-season, \"Wild Bill\" Burgess, the new owner, as a public relations gimmick, stages an 'honorary coach' contest, which Eddie wins. The fans love it, so \"Wild Bill\" fires the coach and hires her. She takes the bunch of overpaid prima donnas that make up the team and turns them around.
