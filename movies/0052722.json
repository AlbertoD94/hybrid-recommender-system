In fact, he and the tiny King Brian, ruler of the little people, are friendly adversaries, continually out-foxing each other. Darby needs a bit of magical help from the wily king when Lord Fitzpatrick replaces him as caretaker with the handsome, strapping young Michael from Dublin. Michael falls in love with Darby's beautiful daughter, Katie, which is all right with Darby; but the lad has a rival in a local ruffian, the son of a devious widow who wants her boy to be the caretaker. King Brian's supernatural assistance is necessary to make everything come out all right, but the sneaky leprechaun won't play matchmaker without a fight. Finally, real trouble comes in the form of the Banshee, and Darby will need all his quick wits to save his daughter from the wicked spirit.","Language":"English, Irish","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VmYjI5YWYtODlkOS00ZjE4LWIzYTItMmQ1ZGJiMzk3MjcxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjUwNzk3NDc@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.2","imdbVotes":"6,827","imdbID":"tt0052722","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Walt Disney Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
