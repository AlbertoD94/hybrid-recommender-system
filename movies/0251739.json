{"Title":"Margaret Cho: I'm the One That I Want","Year":"2000","Rated":"Unrated","Released":"04 Aug 2000","Runtime":"96 min","Genre":"Documentary, Comedy","Director":"Lionel Coleman","Writer":"Margaret Cho","Actors":"Margaret Cho","Plot":"November, 1999, Margaret Cho is home in San Francisco at the Warfield Theater. Cho structures her monologue loosely on her professional life's trajectory: doing stand-up, cast in an ABC-TV sitcom, losing 30 pounds in two weeks for the part, the show's cancellation, a descent into booze, pills, and self-loathing, and a resurrection into her own voice, her own shape, and being the one she wants. Along the way we visit Karl Langerfeld in jail, a lesbian cruise ship, a TV Guide photo shoot, a hospital, bars, and her family's Polk Street bookshop. Takes on being a fag hag, speeding up felatio, casual daily racism, and her mother's phone messages highlight a scabrous, brilliant performance.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MDIxMzUzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk4NjIyMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"59%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"81/100"}],"Metascore":"81","imdbRating":"7.5","imdbVotes":"1,116","imdbID":"tt0251739","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Cho Taussig Productions, Inc.","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
