Dignan has hatched a hare-brained scheme for an as-yet-unspecified crime spree that somehow involves his former boss, the (supposedly) legendary Mr. Henry. With the help of their pathetic neighbor and pal Bob, Anthony and Dignan pull a job and hit the road, where Anthony finds love with motel maid Inez. When our boys finally hook up with Mr. Henry, the ensuing escapade turns out to be far from what anyone expected.","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 wins & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWJlOWExNzctYjIzMC00OTU4LThjZDEtZjgwMzJjM2QyMGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjQ2MjQ5NzM@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"85%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"66/100"}],"Metascore":"66","imdbRating":"7.0","imdbVotes":"68,615","imdbID":"tt0115734","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Columbia Pictures Corporation","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
