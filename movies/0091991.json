But suddenly his father's neurotic psychiatrist advises him to go on vacation in Hawaii instead of spending more money on his son. Since Mark wants to keep his lifestyle, including a fancy car and a flat shared with his friend, he seeks financial support. The only foundation which still accepts applications is for blacks only -- no problem, with lots of bronzing pills and \"soul in his voice\" he sets out to Harvard. Soon he has to realize that being black will cause some people to handle him differently.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M1ZTI5MGUtMDQ1ZS00ZmJkLWFmNjYtNWIzODE2MWI2ZGJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"13%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"33/100"}],"Metascore":"33","imdbRating":"5.3","imdbVotes":"7,551","imdbID":"tt0091991","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Balcor Film Investors, The Steve Tisch Company","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
