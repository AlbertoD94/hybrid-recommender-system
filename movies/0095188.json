Andy has quit his job as a sports journalist and is planning to use the peace and quiet of the country to write the Great American Novel. From the moment the movers' truck gets lost with their furniture, though, there's little peace and less quiet. From a manical mailman to a dead body buried in the garden, Andy is distracted by the town and its wacky inhabitants. His effort at a novel is mediocre, at best, and he's threatened by Elizabeth's foray into writing when she attempts a children's book. Can the Farmers survive the townsfolk and each other?","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2MyNmQ2ZTQtYzE1Ni00MWQwLWE3ZTctMDcxOWE4ZTQzMjE5L2ltYWdlL2ltYWdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc5MjA3OA@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"65%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"50/100"}],"Metascore":"50","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"19,261","imdbID":"tt0095188","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Warner Brothers/Seven Arts","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
