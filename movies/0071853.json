Gathering up the men is a tale in itself but after a bit of a party at Camelot, many decide to leave only to be stopped by God who sends them on a quest: to find the Holy Grail. After a series of individual adventures, the knights are reunited but must face a wizard named Tim, killer rabbits and lessons in the use of holy hand grenades. Their quest comes to an end however when the police intervene - just what you would expect in a Monty Python movie.","Language":"English, French, Latin","Country":"UK","Awards":"3 wins & 3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2IyNTE4YzUtZWU0Mi00MGIwLTgyMmQtMzQ4YzQxYWNlYWE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"97%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"91/100"}],"Metascore":"91","imdbRating":"8.2","imdbVotes":"495,768","imdbID":"tt0071853","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Michael White Productions, Python (Monty) Pictures Limited, National Film Trustee Company","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
