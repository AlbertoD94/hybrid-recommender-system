Bad news is, Hermia's father wants Demetrius for a son-in-law. On the outside is Helena, whose unreturned love burns hot for Demetrius. Hermia and Lysander plan to flee from the city under cover of darkness but are pursued by an enraged Demetrius (who is himself pursued by an enraptured Helena). In the forest, unbeknownst to the mortals, Oberon and Titania (King and Queen of the faeries) are having a spat over a servant boy. The plot twists up when Oberon's head mischief-maker, Puck, runs loose with a flower which causes people to fall in love with the first thing they see upon waking. Throw in a group of labourers preparing a play for the Duke's wedding (one of whom is given a donkey's head and Titania for a lover by Puck) and the complications become fantastically funny.","Language":"English, Italian, Latin","Country":"UK, Italy, USA","Awards":"1 win & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjI5YzcxZmUtMWUzOC00MGJmLWFjODgtYTlhNTViNjFmYzE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTY2MzYyNzA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.4/10"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"61/100"}],"Metascore":"61","imdbRating":"6.4","imdbVotes":"24,143","imdbID":"tt0140379","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
