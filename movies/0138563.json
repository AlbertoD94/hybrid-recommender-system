Although Love won't talk to him and his inquiries lose him financial backing, he comes to believe the coroner's verdict. Portraits emerge: a shy, slight Kurt, weary of touring, embarrassed by fame, hooked on heroin; an out-going Courtney, dramatic, controlling, moving from groupie to star.","Language":"English","Country":"UK","Awards":"1 win & 2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzMxM2ViMzAtYjMxZi00OWI5LThjMmEtYjA3YmIzOTRmMjIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMwMjk0MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"62%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.1","imdbVotes":"6,811","imdbID":"tt0138563","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Strength Ltd.","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
