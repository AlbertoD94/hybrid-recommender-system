{"Title":"They Might Be Giants","Year":"1971","Rated":"G","Released":"09 Jun 1971","Runtime":"98 min","Genre":"Comedy, Mystery, Romance","Director":"Anthony Harvey","Writer":"James Goldman (screenplay), James Goldman (play)","Actors":"George C. Scott, Joanne Woodward, Jack Gilford, Lester Rawlins","Plot":"They Might be Giants chronicles the adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in modern-day New York City. The fact that Sherlock Holmes is a psychotic paranoid and Dr. Watson is a female psychiatrist fascinated by his case is almost beside the point. Dr. Watson follows Holmes across Manhattan and is, against her better judgment, drawn into the master detective's world of intrigue and danger. This is a sweet, goofy and fairly romantic film that asks the questions \"Whose reality is right...and does it really matter?\"","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRkZDhkNzEtNzczMi00Nzg2LWE5ZGYtYWJiMmY0MTk4NTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjI4MjA5MzA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"75%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.8","imdbVotes":"2,650","imdbID":"tt0067848","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
