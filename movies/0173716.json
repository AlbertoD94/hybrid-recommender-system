Demented leads a band of cinema revolutionaries who kidnap Honey Whitlock, a bitchy and aging movie star of big-budget froth. Cecil wants her in his movie, a screed against Hollywood they film during blitzkrieg attacks on a multiplex, a Maryland Film Commission press conference, and the set of a \"Forrest Gump\" sequel. He insists on celibacy; the cast and crew channel sexual energy into the production. With a family-values coalition, aggrieved Teamsters, and the police on their trail, Cecil needs help from porno, kung-fu, and drive-in audiences. What about Honey? Will she bolt or refuse to act? Or will she hit her marks and light up the screen?","Language":"English","Country":"USA, France","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE2YzQ4MDMtZmQ5Yi00YjU5LTkyMzUtYzk5NzY3OTFiM2MwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0NTI0Nw@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"53%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"57/100"}],"Metascore":"57","imdbRating":"6.3","imdbVotes":"13,487","imdbID":"tt0173716","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Le Studio Canal +, Artic Productions LLC, Polar Entertainment Corporation, Ice Cap Production","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
