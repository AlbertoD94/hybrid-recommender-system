It is with a move to Washington that he hits on an outrageous off-the-wall style that catches audience attention. Despite his on-air blue talk, at home he is a loving husband. He needs all the support he can get when he joins NBC in New York and comes up against a very different vision of radio.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 wins & 3 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhjZjAxNzgtNzU3NS00OWQxLWI2ODItMjk0NmRjMTU5MDhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.9/10"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"67/100"}],"Metascore":"67","imdbRating":"6.9","imdbVotes":"33,638","imdbID":"tt0119951","Type":"movie","DVD":"04 Oct 2005","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"WARNER BROTHERS PICTURES","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
