{"Title":"Stop Making Sense","Year":"1984","Rated":"Not Rated","Released":"16 Nov 1984","Runtime":"88 min","Genre":"Documentary, Music","Director":"Jonathan Demme","Writer":"Jonathan Demme, Talking Heads","Actors":"Bernie Worrell, Alex Weir, Steven Scales, Lynn Mabry","Plot":"David Byrne walks onto the stage and does a solo \"Psycho Killer.\" Jerry Harrison, Tina Weymouth and Chris Frantz join him for two more songs. The crew is busy, still setting up. Then, three more musicians and two back-up singers join the band. Everybody sings, plays, harmonizes, dances, and runs. They change instruments and clothes. Bryne appears in the Big Suit. The backdrop is often black, but sometimes it displays words, images, or children's drawings. The band cooks for 18 songs, the lyrics are clear, the house rocks. In this concert film, the Talking Heads hardly talk, don't stop, and always make sense.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 wins & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjUxZmZmYzQtMzgzNy00OGVmLWE5M2ItOTA5MTZiMTk4MTY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI4MjkwNjA@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"100%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"89/100"}],"Metascore":"89","imdbRating":"8.6","imdbVotes":"12,845","imdbID":"tt0088178","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Arnold Stiefel Company","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
