Count Dracula knows that if he fails to drink a required amount of pure virgin's [pronounced \"wirgin's\"] blood, it's time to move into a permanent coffin. His assistant (Renfield?) suggests that the Count and he pick up his coffin and take a road trip to Italy, where families are known to be particularly religious, and therefore should be an excellent place to search for a virgin bride. They do, only to encounter a family with not one, but FOUR virgins, ready for marriage. The Count discovers one-by-one that the girls are not as pure as they say they are, meanwhile a handsome servant/Communist begins to observe strange behaviour from the girls who do spend the night with the Count. It's a race for Dracula to discover who's the real virgin, before he either dies from malnourishment or from the wooden stake of the Communist!","Language":"English","Country":"Italy, France","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGU2ZGJmODYtZWUwZS00NTcxLWE2ZGMtMWY1NzUxOGJiZTM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTc5MDI5NjE@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.2/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"69%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.2","imdbVotes":"5,131","imdbID":"tt0071233","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
