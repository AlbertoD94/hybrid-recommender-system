We follow Ashtray as he returns to the place he grew up in and meet his father and his basket-case friends. Crazy stuff happens. For example, Ashtray is older than his father and his best friend Loc Dog's grandmother is a trigger-happy old lady who blames her eccentric-looking kid for not being tough enough.","Language":"English, Spanish","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2NmM2M2MWItNjdlMC00ZWI3LTkwODUtZDNkYWZjYjgzZjY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.6/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"31%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.6","imdbVotes":"47,617","imdbID":"tt0116126","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Ivory Way Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
