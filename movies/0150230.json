{"Title":"The Cruise","Year":"1998","Rated":"PG-13","Released":"23 Oct 1998","Runtime":"76 min","Genre":"Documentary","Director":"Bennett Miller","Writer":"N/A","Actors":"Timothy 'Speed' Levitch","Plot":"Affectionate portrait of Tim \"Speed\" Levitch, a tour guide for Manhattan's Gray Line double-decker buses. He talks fast, is in love with the city, and dispenses historical facts, architectural analysis, and philosophical musings in equal measures. He's reflective and funny about cruising: he loves it, got in it to meet women, and he'd quit work if he could. His personal life is disclosed in small doses: he takes home $200 a week for 20 hours work, home is his suitcase and wherever he can flop, he's been arrested for going out on the roof tops of skyscrapers to see his city; he stands between the towers of the World Trade Center, spins until he's dizzy, then looks up.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"5 wins & 5 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY5Njg5NTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTIzMzIzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.7/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"86%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"69/100"}],"Metascore":"69","imdbRating":"7.7","imdbVotes":"1,592","imdbID":"tt0150230","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Columbia, TriStar Pictures","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
