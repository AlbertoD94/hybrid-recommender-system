Racial integration comes to the high school, TV is killing burlesque, and rock and roll is pushing the Four Lads off the Hit Parade. Ben, a high school senior, and his older brother Van are exploring \"the other\": in Ben's case, it's friendship with Sylvia, a Black student; with Van, it's a party in the WASP part of town and falling for a debutante, Dubbie. Sylvia gives Ben tickets to a James Brown concert; Dubbie invites Van to a motel: new worlds open. Meanwhile, their dad Nate, who runs a numbers game, loses big to a small-time pusher, Little Melvin; a partnership ensues.","Language":"English, German, Yiddish","Country":"USA","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNDY5MzczMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjY4MzQ3._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"85%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"75/100"}],"Metascore":"75","imdbRating":"7.0","imdbVotes":"6,371","imdbID":"tt0165859","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Baltimore Pictures, Spring Creek Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
