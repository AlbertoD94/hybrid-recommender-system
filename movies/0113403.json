As the cast he assembles are still available even at Christmas and are prepared to do it on a 'profit sharing' basis (that is, they may not get paid anything) he cannot expect - and does not get - the cream of the cream. But although they all bring their own problems and foibles along, something bigger starts to emerge in the perhaps aptly named village of Hope.","Language":"English","Country":"UK","Awards":"1 win & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMDEwMDAyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwOTUwNTk4._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"7.1/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"81%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"7.1","imdbVotes":"2,339","imdbID":"tt0113403","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
