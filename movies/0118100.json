Through flashbacks, the film discloses the relationships among Ivan and his brother Alex, a cop with a cleanliness fetish; siblings Juliette and Jimmy, Ivan's partners in a seedy nightclub; the love triangle of Alex, Juliette, and Marie, a professor of philosophy; and of Alex and his nephew, Ivan's dour, stoic son. Ivan's death changes every relationship. Images of paragliders, sun bathers, and opera suggest an expansive, colorful world outside the constricted lives of these characters.","Language":"French","Country":"France","Awards":"3 wins & 7 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGUyMzU3YjEtNDlkZC00NzcwLTg0ZjUtNWNkMWY4M2M5MDU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTA0MjU0Ng@@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"82%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.8","imdbVotes":"1,952","imdbID":"tt0118100","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"N/A","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
