Three are from Kyoto, where Storey manages Pachinco palaces. Each has a distinctive personality: a nun, a child bearer, a gambler, a student of Kabuki, a horsewoman with a pet pig, a maid. Philip throws off his strait-laced and repressed attitudes, immersing himself in pleasure. After about a year, the women begin to assert their own power. Side adventures pre-figure the household's breakup, and the women depart in one way or another, one at at time. Philip's fate is in the hands of Palmira, his favorite.","Language":"English, Italian, Japanese, Latin","Country":"UK, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Germany","Awards":"2 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzZkYWE1OGUtMzViOS00YmVmLTllM2EtYTdhMWYyYWU0ZDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxMTY0OTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.8/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"41%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"36/100"}],"Metascore":"36","imdbRating":"5.8","imdbVotes":"3,732","imdbID":"tt0154443","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Woodline Productions, Delux Productions, Movie Masters, Continental Films","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
