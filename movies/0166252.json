Helen runs, miles a day, to burn off energy: she's an emotional celibate. Going through the post at her shop, she finds a romantic and poetic letter between the couch cushions, unsigned, and thinks it's for her. It melts her resistance to feelings, and soon she undertakes an affair with Johnny, a collegiate employee. (He sees the letter and thinks she wrote it to him; he quotes some of it, so she thinks he wrote it to her.) In the background are Helen's long-time friend, George, who loves her, and her mother who abruptly left on a long trip months' before. Discovering who actually wrote the letter brings insight and promise.","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMyOTc5Y2QtMjNhNC00OTEyLWEyMzAtMTA0ZDU0MzVlOTE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjMwMjk0MTQ@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"33%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"5.5","imdbVotes":"4,073","imdbID":"tt0166252","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"DreamWorks SKG","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
