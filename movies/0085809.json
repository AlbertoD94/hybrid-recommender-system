Without narration, the film shows the world in a pristine condition and untouched: blue skies, beautiful landscapes and endless vistas. The man-made world is much less appealing. Essentially a montage using a variety of film techniques to provide a visually stunning montage of images.","Language":"None, Hopi, English","Country":"USA","Awards":"6 wins & 1 nomination.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjlmMWVhYjQtNTZmOC00OTE4LWIxMGItOTg2OTlkZTZkYmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"8.3/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"90%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"72/100"}],"Metascore":"72","imdbRating":"8.3","imdbVotes":"34,963","imdbID":"tt0085809","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"IRE Productions","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
