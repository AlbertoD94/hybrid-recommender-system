Later, he finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time, inadvertently interrupting an assassination by a feared Ninja-cult. As he is now the only man to have seen the face of the cult's warrior-leader and lived, he soon realizes that he is facing a markedly foreshortened life-expectancy. Teaming up with a friendly samurai couple, on a two-centuries-old blood-feud with the Ninja, he struggles to survive. Finally, recuperating on an island-fortress, he learns swordsmanship, and perhaps, a little about courage, honor, love, and loyalty. The requisite final confrontation is rife with bloody swordplay and spectacular martial-arts action sequences.","Language":"English, Japanese","Country":"USA","Awards":"N/A","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ5Y2RlYjgtMjRhOS00Y2UxLWIxZjEtMzEyMzk0OGU4YjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"6.0/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"8%"}],"Metascore":"N/A","imdbRating":"6.0","imdbVotes":"4,718","imdbID":"tt0113360","Type":"movie","DVD":"N/A","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Universal Pictures, Davis Entertainment","Website":"N/A","Response":"True"}
